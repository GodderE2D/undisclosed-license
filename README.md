# üîê Undisclosed License

A strongly restrictive license, but concise and in plain English.

---

Do you need a strongly restrictive license? Do you not believe in open source? Are you a Metaverse fan? Are you a Windows or Mac user? If so, this license is for you! With this license, no one can use your piece of software without you knowing about it.

## Applying the license to your piece of software

If you would like to use the Undisclosed License for your piece of software, follow these steps:

<!-- Ensure the below URL is up-to-date for each version change made. -->

1. Copy the contents of the [latest version of the Undisclosed License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GodderE2D/undisclosed-license/main/versions/1/1.0/LICENSE). [(local version)](./versions/1/1.0/LICENSE)
2. Make a new file in your piece of software's source code's root directory named `LICENSE`.
3. Paste the contents of the license into the new file.
4. Replace the placeholders of the year and the copyright owner's name with the current year and your name or your team/company's name.
5. Ensure that if you have a license field in a configuration file, such as `package.json`, it is replaced with "Undisclosed" or "SEE LICENSE IN LICENSE" if the former is not appropriate.
6. If you would like to, you can add a comment on the top of every file in your source code that states that it is licensed under the Undisclosed License.
